			<p class="children_data_page_birthdate"><b>Born: 2006</b></p>
			<p class="children_data_page_class">Grade 7</p>
			<p class="children_data_page_text">Fatoumata’s place at school is far from guaranteed. Her parents are regularly late with the payment of tuition, they even had a three-month delay recently. </p> 
            <p class="children_data_page_text">Her parents are illiterate, but even though they never went to school, but they understand the importance of studying. Her father is a farmer and her mother is at home. Their living is getting harder and harder due to the recent drought. The family isn’t big compared to other families in the area, as Fatoumata lives only with four siblings and her parents. </p>
            <p class="children_data_page_text">Fatoumata studies well and loves going to school. In her free time, she helps her family at home or reads. As the oldest girl, she gets the greater part of the housework. Her supporter will hopefully support her until university.  </p>
