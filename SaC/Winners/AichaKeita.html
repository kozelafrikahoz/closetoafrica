			<p class="children_data_page_birthdate"><b>Born: 2010</b></p>
			<p class="children_data_page_class">Grade 3</p>
            <p class="children_data_page_text"> Aicha loves going to school and is an outstanding student with an average of 8,1/10. As for the tuition fees, her family has a debt of 3 months, which has been handled patiently by the school so far.</p>
            <p class="children_data_page_text"> Her father is illiterate and unemployed. He has never been to school. Usually, he makes a living for his large family out of occasional construction jobs. Aicha has an older sister, two younger brothers and three younger sisters. 5 out of the 8 children go to the Winners’ School, which is a severe financial burden for the unemployed father. </p>
            <p class="children_data_page_text"> Aicha doesn’t play a lot when she isn’t at school. As she is the second oldest girl in the family, it’s compulsory for her to help with the housework. When we met her, her clothes were oversized for her and here slippers appeared outworn. </p>
