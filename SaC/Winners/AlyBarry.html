			<img class="Children_data_page_image" src="../../static/images/SaC/Winners/AlyBarry.jpg" alt="">	
			<p class="children_data_page_birthdate"><b>Born: 2013.03.23.</b></p>
			<p class="children_data_page_class">Grade 1</p>
			<p class="children_data_page_text">Aly was not yet 6 but he was already the best student of the first grade, with an average school result of 8.7/10. It may not be so surprising because his mother is a teacher, and both of his parents are literate. His father is a driver, who almost completed primary school. Aly’s mother finished high school as well. He has only one older sister, who is attending a grammar school now. His good family background, the low number of children in the family, and his brightness are likely to take him far, may be even to university. Although their family is small, Aly’s parents financially support as many as 12 persons, so it would be a great relief if the parents at least the boy’s school fees will not have to be payed in the future. </p>
