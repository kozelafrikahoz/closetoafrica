			<p class="learn_more_page_text"> In 2018 with the financial contribution of Xeless and using the Project WET foundation materials we delivered a succesful Hand Wash project in our school in Bamako. This included the refurbishement of the school toilets, the installation of a hand wash  station and the sensibilization of the children about the importance of hand washing.</p>
			<p class="learn_more_page_text">In 2019 we are planning to roll out the Hand Wash project to our other supported school, the School of Winners. </p>
			<p class="learn_more_page_text"> This school has been working for 5 years practically without toilets. As the number of children increased steadily this situation has become a more and more serious problem. This year the founder of the school, M. Guindo set about improving the sanitation of the school and started to build the toilets. </p>
			<p class="learn_more_page_text_last">We propose to help him financially to finish the construction of four toilet cubicles made (for the time being only in concrete) and create a designated place for a water container with a tap for the children to be able to wash their hands after the toilet.  The container will be filled up every morning from a nearby well.</p>
			<p class="learn_more_page_text">Current status of the two toilets that are waiting for an enclosure:</p>

			<p class="learn_more_page_text">As soon as the construction of the facilities is finished we propose to offer a Hand Wash campaign for the children in the school. The campaign would involve our volunteer(s) to go to Mali and give an interractive talk  in the form of a school lesson on why, how and when it is important to wash hands. We would like to build on last yearâ€™s lesson plans which involved interactive games, a song and simplified scientific explanations. We would talk about the importance of hand wash and hygene  during the lessons. </p>
